# pubsubplus-v1alpha1
// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Run locally outside the cluster

Additional Prerequisites:

*  go version 1.18
*  docker version 17.03+.
*  kubectl

1. Clone this git repo, checkout to this branch
2. Change to the project root
```sh
cd pubsubplus-kubernetes-operator/
```
3. Create Custom Resource and start the operator
```sh
make install run
```
4. Use the sample `EventBroker` resource to create an HA cluster
```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/pubsubplus_v1alpha1_eventbroker.yaml
```
5. Wait for the pods to come up
```sh
kubectl get po -w --show-labels
```
6. Forward services at port 8080 and 8008 to localhost to use WebAdmin and Try-me. May also forward port 55555 for SMF messaging. Example:
```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/<service-name> 8080:8080 &
```

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/pubsubplus-v1alpha1:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/pubsubplus-v1alpha1:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
